                   IPv4 routes with an IPv6 next hop
               draft-chroboczek-intarea-v4-via-v6-latest

Abstract

   We propose "v4-via-v6" routing, a technique that uses IPv6 next-hop
   addresses for routing IPv4 packets, thus making it possible to route
   IPv4 packets across a network where routers have not been assigned
   IPv4 addresses.  We describe the technique, and discuss its
   operational implications.

1.  Introduction

   The dominant form of routing in the Internet is next-hop routing,
   where a routing protocol constructs a routing table which is used by
   a forwarding process to forward packets.  The routing table is a data
   structure that maps network prefixes in a given family (IPv4 or IPv6)
   to next hops, pairs of an outgoing interface and a neighbor's network
   address, for example:

       destination                      next hop
     2001:db8:0:1::/64               eth0, fe80::1234:5678
     203.0.113.0/24                  eth0, 192.0.2.1

   When a packet is routed according to a given routing table entry, the
   forwarding plane uses a neighbor discovery protocol (the Neighbor
   Discovery protocol (ND) [RFC4861] in the case of IPv6, the Address
   Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC0826] in the case of IPv4) to map the
   next-hop address to a link-layer address (a "MAC address"), which is
   then used to construct the link-layer frames that encapsulate
   forwarded packets.

   It is apparent from the description above that there is no
   fundamental reason why the destination prefix and the next-hop
   address should be in the same address family: there is nothing
   preventing an IPv6 packet from being routed through a next hop with
   an IPv4 address (in which case the next hop's MAC address will be
   obtained using ARP), or, conversely, an IPv4 packet from being routed
   through a next hop with an IPv6 address.  (In fact, it is even
   possible to store link-layer addresses directly in the next-hop entry
   of the routing table, thus avoiding the use of an address resolution
   protocol altogether, which is commonly done in networks using the OSI
   protocol suite).

   The case of routing IPv4 packets through an IPv6 next hop is
   particularly interesting, since it makes it possible to build
   networks that have no IPv4 addresses except at the edges and still
   provide IPv4 connectivity to edge hosts.  In addition, since an IPv6
   next hop can use a link-local address that is autonomously
   configured, the use of such routes enables a mode of operation where
   the network core has no statically assigned IP addresses of either
   family, which significantly reduces the amount of manual
   configuration required.  (See also [RFC7404] for a discussion of the
   issues involved with such an approach.)

   We call a route towards an IPv4 prefix that uses an IPv6 next hop a
   "v4-via-v6" route.

   [RFC8950] discusses advertising of IPv4 NLRI with a next-hop address
   that belongs to the IPv6 protocol, but confines itself to how this is
   carried and advertised in the BGP protocol.  This document, on the
   other hand, discusses the concept of v4-via-v6 routes independently
   of any specific routing protocol, their design and operational
   considerations, and the implications of using them.

   { Editor note, to be removed before publication.  This document is
   heavily based on draft-ietf-babel-v4viav6.  When draft-ietf-babel-
   v4viav6 was going through IESG eval, Warren raised concerns that
   something this fundamental deserved to be documented in a separate,
   standalone document, so that it can be more fully discussed, and,
   more importantly, referenced cleanly in the future.}

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Operation

   Next-hop routing is implemented by two separate components, the
   routing protocol and the forwarding plane, that communicate through a
   shared data structure, the routing table.

3.1.  Structure of the routing table

   The routing table is a data structure that maps address prefixes to
   next-hops, pairs of the form (interface, address).  In traditional
   next-hop routing, the routing table maps IPv4 prefixes to IPv4 next
   hops, and IPv6 addresses to IPv6 next hops.  With v4-via-v6 routing,
   the routing table is extended so that an IPv4 prefix may map to
   either an IPv4 or an IPv6 next hop.

3.2.  Operation of the forwarding plane

   The forwarding plane is the part of the routing implementation that
   is executed for every forwarded packet.  As a packet arrives, the
   forwarding plane consults the routing table, selects a single route
   matching the packet, determines the next-hop address, and forwards
   the packet to the next-hop address.

   With v4-via-v6 routing, the address family of the next-hop address is
   no longer determined by the address family of the prefix: since the
   routing table may map an IPv4 prefix to either an IPv4 or an IPv6
   next-hop, the forwarding plane must be able to determine, on a per-
   packet basis, whether the next-hop address is an IPv4 or an IPv6
   address, and to use that information in order to choose the right
   address resolution protocol to use (ARP for IP4, ND for IPv6).

3.3.  Operation of routing protocols

   The routing protocol is the part of the routing implementation that
   is executed asynchronously from the forwarding plane, and whose role
   is to build the routing table.  Since v4-via-v6 routing is a
   generalisation of traditional next-hop routing, v4-via-v6 can
   interoperate with existing routing protocols: a traditional routing
   protocol produces a traditional next-hop routing table, which can be
   used by an implementation supporting v4-via-v6 routing.

   However, in order to use the additional flexibility provided by
   v4-via-v6 routing, routing protocols will need to be extended with
   the ability to populate the routing table with v4-via-v6 routes when
   an IPv4 address is not available or when the available IPv4 addresses
   are not suitable for use as a next-hop (e.g., not stable enough).

3.3.1.  Distance-vector routing protocols

3.3.2.  Link-state routing protocols

4.  ICMP Considerations

   The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv4, or simply ICMP)
   [RFC0792] is a protocol related to IPv4 that is primarily used to
   carry diagnostic and debugging information.  ICMPv4 packets may be
   originated by end hosts (e.g., the "destination unreachable, port
   unreachable" ICMPv4 packet), but they may also be originated by
   intermediate routers (e.g., most other kinds of "destination
   unreachable" packets).

   Some protocols deployed in the Internet rely on ICMPv4 packets sent
   by intermediate routers.  Most notably, path MTU Discovery (PMTUd)
   [RFC1191] is an algorithm executed by end hosts to discover the
   maximum packet size that a route is able to carry.  While there exist
   variants of PMTUd that are purely end-to-end [RFC4821], the variant
   most commonly deployed in the Internet has a hard dependency on
   ICMPv4 packets originated by intermediate routers: if intermediate
   routers are unable to send ICMPv4 packets, PMTUd may lead to
   persistent black-holing of IPv4 traffic.

   Due to this kind of dependency, every router that is able to forward
   IPv4 traffic SHOULD be able originate ICMPv4 traffic.  Since the
   extension described in this document enables routers to forward IPv4
   traffic received over an interface that has not been assigned an IPv4
   address, a router implementing this extension MUST be able to
   originate ICMPv4 packets even when the outgoing interface has not
   been assigned an IPv4 address.

   In such a situation, if the router has an interface that has been
   assigned an IPv4 address (other than the loopback address), or if an
   IPv4 address has been assigned to the router itself (to the "loopback
   interface"), then that IPv4 address may be used as the source of
   originated ICMPv4 packets.  If no IPv4 address is available, the
   router could use the experimental mechanism described in Requirement
   R-22 of Section 4.8 [RFC7600], which consists of using the dummy
   address 192.0.0.8 as the source address of originated ICMPv4 packets.
   Note however that using the same address on multiple routers may
   hamper debugging and fault isolation, e.g., when using the
   "traceroute" utility.

   {Editor note: It would be surprising to many operators to see
   something like:

   > $ traceroute -n 8.8.8.8
   traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
    1  192.168.0.1  1.894 ms  1.953 ms  1.463 ms
    2  192.0.0.8  9.012 ms  8.852 ms  12.211 ms
    3  192.0.0.8  8.445 ms  9.426 ms  9.781 ms
    4  192.0.0.8  9.984 ms  10.282 ms  10.763 ms
    5  192.0.0.8  13.994 ms  13.031 ms  12.948 ms
    6  192.0.0.8  27.502 ms  26.895 ms
    7  8.8.8.8  26.509 ms

   Is this a problem though?  If this becomes common practice, will
   operators just come to understand that the repeated 192.0.0.8 is not
   actually a looping packet, but rather that the packet is (probably!)
   making forward progress?  What if it goes: 192.168.0.1 -> 192.0.0.8
   -> 10.10.10.10 -> 192.0.0.8 -> 172.16.14.2 -> dest?

   In addition, see RFC5837, and, as a side note, Bill Fenner is working
   on an update to that document. }

   { Editor note / question: 192.0.0.8 is assigned in the
   [IANA-IPV4-REGISTRY] as the "IPv4 dummy address".  It may be used as
   a Source Address, and was requested in [RFC7600] to be used as the
   IPv4 source address when synthesizing an ICMPv4 packet to mirror an
   ICMPv6 error message.  This is all fine and good - but, 192.0.0.0/24
   is commonly considered a bogon or martian

   Example (from a Juniper router):

   wkumari@rtr2.pao> show route martians

   inet.0:
                0.0.0.0/0 exact -- allowed
                0.0.0.0/8 orlonger -- disallowed
                127.0.0.0/8 orlonger -- disallowed
                192.0.0.0/24 orlonger -- disallowed
                240.0.0.0/4 orlonger -- disallowed
                224.0.0.0/4 exact -- disallowed
                224.0.0.0/24 exact -- disallowed

   This means that these packets are likely to be filtered in many
   places, and so ICMP packets with this source address are likely to be
   dropped.  Is this a major issue?  Would requesting another address be
   a better solution?  Would it help?  If it were to be allocated from
   some more global pool, it would still likely require "magic" to allow
   it to pass BCP38 filters. }

5.  Implementation Status

   ( This section to be removed before publication. )

   As this document does not really define a protocol, this
   implementation status section is much less formal.  Instead, it is
   being used as a place to list implementations which are known to
   support this functionality, examples, notes, etc.  This information
   is provided as a guide to the reader, and is not intended to be a
   complete list, nor endorsement, etc.  If you know of an
   implementation which is not listed, please let the authors know.

5.1.  Mikrotik RouterOS

   Mikrotik RouterOS Version 7.11beta2. {Editor note: I believe it has
   been supported for a very ling time, but this was the version I
   tested with.  Reminder to self to ask Mikrotik when it was added.}

   As an example: [wkumari@Dulles-CCR] /ip/route> print Flags: D -
   DYNAMIC; I - INACTIVE, A - ACTIVE; c - CONNECT, s - STATIC, d - DHCP,
   v - VPN; H - HW-OFFLOADED Columns: DST-ADDRESS, GATEWAY, DISTANCE #
   DST-ADDRESS GATEWAY DISTANCE 0 As 192.0.2.0/24
   fe80::201:5cff:feb2:1646%1_Comcast 1

5.2.  Arista EOS

   Arista has supported static IPv4 routes with IPv6 nexthops since EOS-
   4.30.1.

5.3.  The Babel routing protocol

   As noted above, this document is heavily based on RFC9229 (nee draft-
   ietf-babel-v4viav6), and this functionality is supported by babeld.

   Pasted below is email sent to the babel mailing list (archived at
   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/babel/
   QtFi3F4TFfF7fXXlkHSpEnuT44Y/)

   A route across three IPv6-only nodes:

  $ ip route show 10.0.0.2
  10.0.0.2 via inet6 fe80::216:3eff:fe00:1 dev lxcbr0 proto babel onlink

   Here's how it's logged by babeld:

  10.0.0.2/32 from 0.0.0.0/0 metric 384 (384) refmetric 288 id
  02:16:3e:ff:fe:9a:5e:22 seqno 36425 chan (255) age 15 via lxcbr0 neigh
  fe80::216:3eff:fe00:1 (installed)

   Traceroute is a little confusing:

   $ traceroute 10.0.0.2
   traceroute to 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
    1  192.0.0.8 (192.0.0.8)  0.079 ms  0.019 ms  0.014 ms
    2  192.0.0.8 (192.0.0.8)  0.040 ms  0.023 ms  0.042 ms
    3  192.0.0.8 (192.0.0.8)  0.061 ms  0.030 ms  0.030 ms
    4  10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2)  0.060 ms  0.040 ms  0.039 ms

   PMTUD works fine (thanks to Toke):

   19:58:47.402871 IP 192.168.0.27.60046 > 10.0.0.2.22: Flags [.],\

6.  Security Considerations

   The techniques described in this document make routing more flexible
   by allowing IPv4 routes to propagate across a section of a network
   that has only been assigned IPv6 addresses.  This additional
   flexibility might invalidate otherwise reasonable assumptions made by
   network administrators, which could potentially cause security
   issues.

   For example, if an island of IPv4-only hosts is separated from the
   IPv4 Internet by routers that have not been assigned IPv4 addresses,
   a network administrator might reasonably assume that the IPv4-only
   hosts are unreachable from the IPv4 Internet.  This assumption is
   broken if the intermediary routers implement v4-via-v6 routing, which
   might make the IPv4-only hosts reachable from the IPv4 Internet.  If
   this is not desirable, then the network administrator must filter out
   the undesirable traffic in the forwarding plane by implementing
   suitable packet filtering rules.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
