I started down the lines of \"The above paragraph notes that the mapping is from prefixes to next-hop pairs; sometimes resolving this next-hop pair first requires resolving an intermediate route - this is referred to as recur... \" before deciding that this was clunky...  I'm make the excuse that I'm super-jetlagged at the moment :-) \r\n\r\nI'll commit this. please see if you can massage it into something which flows better. I've requested a slot at the IntArea meeting to hopefully ask for WGLC, and so we should make sure that we post a new version well in advance of the meeting... ",
